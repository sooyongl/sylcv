abstract = {{Comets are dangerous. Thus monitoring for the risk of comets striking Earth is vital to ensure the safety of humankind. We recently discovered a comet, approximately 10-15km in size, that is heading directly towards Earth. Our orbital calculations estimate this comet will strike Earth in approximately 6 months and 14 days. We urge all politicians to take this risk seriously and begin operations to destroy this comet immediately.}},
